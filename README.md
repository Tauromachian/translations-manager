# Translations Manager

Project build to handle translations. Self host this thing if you like it. Maybe I'll do my own hosting solution.

## Tech Stack

- [Deno](https://deno.land/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Drizzle](https://drizzle-orm.vercel.app/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)

Everything else is pure javascript.

## Who is this for?

This is not for small projects.
If you have 2 languages that you know, there is no reason to use this.
As your app and the translations gets bigger, you may bring in someone that can translate but can't code.

Also, you don't want to be running your pipelines for every change to the translations.
That stuff costs money

Aaaand you would be able to reuse translations across different projects.
